        "thinking": "The greenhouse effect depends on atmospheric pressure and optical depth. Mars\u2019 CO\u2082\u2011rich air is only ~6\u202fmbar, so its optical thickness is tiny; it can\u2019t hold much infrared radiation. Thus the weak greenhouse warms the surface only a few kelvins. Other factors (low H\u2082O, distance from Sun) help, but the thin atmosphere is the main reason.  \n\nAnswer: 1",
