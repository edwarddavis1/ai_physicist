        "thinking": "\n\nThe 1:2:4 orbital resonance among Jupiter\u2019s moons Io, Europa, and Ganymede means their orbital periods are simple multiples of each other. This causes gravitational interactions that perturb Io\u2019s orbit, making it slightly elliptical (eccentric). The textbook explains that Io\u2019s eccentric orbit, driven by these perturbations, leads to tidal flexing as it orbits Jupiter, generating internal heat and causing intense volcanic activity. None of the other options correctly describe this mechanism. \n\nAnswer: 8",

The textbook emphasizes that objects like asteroids, which orbit the Sun, exhibit motion relative to the fixed background stars. This motion becomes evident when comparing images taken at different times, allowing astronomers to identify them as moving points of light. Other options, such as brightness, color, or emitting radiation, are either incorrect (e.g., asteroids don\u2019t emit their own light) or not the primary method for detection. The correct principle is the detection of proper motion in time-lapse imaging. \n\nAnswer: 3",
