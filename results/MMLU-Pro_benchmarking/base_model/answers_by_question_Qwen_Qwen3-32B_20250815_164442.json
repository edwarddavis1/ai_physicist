Ionizing radiation transfers energy but does not induce radioactivity in the food because the food's atoms aren't transformed into radioactive isotopes. Options like \"becomes slightly radioactive\" (1) are incorrect, as the food remains non-radioactive. The correct principle is that gamma irradiation is a non-nuclear process for food safety. \n\nAnswer: 6",
