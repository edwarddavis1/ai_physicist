Assignment: Central Language Model for AI Physicist
Background: At FirstPrinciples we are developing an AI Physicist, an automated AI system that will assist in the day-to-day tasks of a human physicist to tackle any or all aspects of the scientific process, including generating a properly formulated research hypothesis and executing the testing of a hypothesis. An AI Physicist can be thought of as a "brain with hands", where the brain is a central language model specialized in physics, or certain subdomains, and the hands are external tools able to perform tasks that the language model would not be good at, e.g. mathematical reasoning. The specialized AI Physicist should demonstrate increased performance in said subdomains or tasks compared to generic models and be able to discover novel insights about physics.

Your Task: For this assignment, we would like to focus on the central language model. How would you go about specializing a model in the domain of physics? Feel free to go into any direction you see fit, for example post-training, fine tuning, reinforcement learning, tool usage, etc.

Outline your approach and submit your code in the format of your choice, e.g. Jupyter Notebook, GitHub repo, Python scripts. Use whichever dataset, model, training procedure, or benchmarking you see fit, and feel free to include comments, documentation, data, visualization as necessary. We acknowledge that this is an open ended question that cannot be solved in a week, we are interested in understanding your thought process but not in a production level tool. There are no right or wrong answers.
